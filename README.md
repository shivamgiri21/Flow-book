# Flow-book
I developed an online platform that functions as a marketplace for buying and selling used books, similar to OLX. This project was built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with additional technologies such as Tailwind CSS, Axios, cookies, tokens, and APIs.

The website provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to register and log in. Once logged in, users can post advertisements to sell their books, including relevant details such as book condition, price, and location. Interested buyers can then contact sellers directly to arrange purchases.

One of the key features of the platform is the ability to search for nearby sellers. By utilizing location data, users can easily find sellers within their vicinity, making it convenient for both buyers and sellers to connect and facilitate transactions.

To enhance security and protect user information, the project utilizes token-based authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access specific features and perform actions such as updating or deleting their advertisements.

Throughout the development process, I leveraged various technologies and tools to optimize the performance and functionality of the website. The implementation of APIs allowed for seamless integration with external services, enabling enhanced features and data retrieval.

By creating this online marketplace, I aimed to provide a reliable and efficient platform for individuals to buy and sell used books. The project showcases my proficiency in front-end and back-end development, as well as my ability to work with modern web technologies to create user-centric applications.
